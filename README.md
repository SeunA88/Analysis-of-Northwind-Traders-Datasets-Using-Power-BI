## Introduction

Data visualization is an important aspect in Power BI that enhances understanding of data, communication of insights, and decision-making based on generated insights; by representing data graphically in visually appealing and easily understandable manner. 

In this task, an interactive dashboard was created by combining multiple visualizations with each telling its own story. The data used for this dashboard creation is Bank deposit dataset(https://github.com/SeunA88/Early-steps-with-Power-BI-Dashboard-and-DAX/blob/main/bank-full.csv). It basically contains information about bank depositors/clients such as name, age, marital status, age, credit history, loan history as well as other important information. Also, the  data details the different bank campaigns carried out alongside their outcomes with each depositors/clients.

## Creating the Dashboard

In creating the dashboard, some data were selected to aid understandng and to bring out some insights from the data. The following data were focussed on and visualised in the dashboard. 

Average age of the bank clients/depositors: This gives an insight into the average age of depositors at the bank and informed decisions can be made as to what age range can be focussed on when campaigning to clients about new bank term deposits. From the data, it can be seen that 41 years is the average age of the bank depositors.
  
- Average yearly balance of the bank clients/depositors: This gives an insight into the average yearly balance of the bank depositors and can also be used to narrow down campaign focus to prospective clients. From the data, it can be seen that $1,362 is the average yearly balance of the bank depositors.
  
- Total number of subscribed/target clients : An insight into how many of the clients/ depositors subscribed to the term deposits after campaigns is seen here, and also which clients haven't subscribed but are still targets/potential subscribers. A total 45,211 clients were found.
    
- Total campaign by job type: This gives an insight into the job type that had the highest total number of campaigns. It can be seen that blue-collar, management and technician jobs topped the chart in the campaigns.
  
- Total number of poutcome by education: This gives an insight into the Education level of depositors based on previous campaign outcomes. It shows the focus of the previous campaign was majorly on secondary school level, followed by Tertiary level.  Depending on these outcomes and targets, campaigns can be tailored towards whatever level of education can give the desired outcome.
  
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by credit in default: This gives an insight into the percentage of depositors with credit in default. Over 95% of depositors do not have a credit in default.
  
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by marital status: This gives an insight into the marital status of the depositors. About 60% of the depositors are married, about 27% are single while about 12 % are divorced.
- 
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by campaign: What are the outcomes of the campaign based on client subscription? How many campaigns were carried out before the client subscribed for term deposit? These insights can be drawn from this visual.
  
- Average balance by subscribed/target clients: From this visual, it can be seen that about 72% of clients haven't subscribed to the term deposit yet, also depositors that have subscribed to the term deposit have an average yearly balance of about $1,804.
  
- A slicer was added to the dashboard to help in filtering the subscribed/target clients. When filter is selected as 'yes" or "no", data can be compared across the dashboard and an insight into a summary/update of the success of the campaign projects can be visualised.

## Conclusion
In the two tasks above, Data visulaization tools and DAX were used to communicate insights that can be useful in targeting and focusing on specific client types and campaigns that can help in maximizing the number of prospective clients to sign up for term deposits with the bank.
